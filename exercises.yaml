Mechanics: Isolation
Type: Basic or Auxiliary
Instructions:
- Place latched belt on high pulley cable by attaching carabiner on belt buckle.
  Grasp attached belt
- ' face away from pulley'
- ' and place head in belt loop. With belt above ears'
- ' clamp belt snugly around head by tightly gripping ends close to back of
  mid-head. With neck braced and assistance of arm'
- ' lunge forward to angle torso forward with feet staggered. Place hand on
  lower thigh for support.'
- Pull head forward and down by flexing neck until chin touches upper chest.
  Return by hyperextending neck until head is angled upward. Repeat.
- Use neck to pull belt rather than allowing hand to assist. Keep clinched
  grip on belt against back of mid-head throughout movement. Clamping belt
  higher up further from base of skull will permit torque throughout fuller
  range of motion
- ' particularly range of motion nearer full flexion. Woven cotton or cloth
  belts tend to slip less from forehead. If belt slips from head'
- ' place small towel between belt and head. Cable carabiner slips to one
  side on square buckles and stresses belts structural integrity under heavy
  loads. Rounded buckle is more ideal since it provides more even stress on
  belt. Belts not made specifically for weight training may cause injury if
  they fail under load in which they were not designed. Exercise can also
  be performed off of rack with belt'
- ' nylon rope'
- ' and plate holder from wrist roller. Nylon rope offers less friction on
  smooth rounded fixed surface. Alternatively'
- ' non-nylon ropes can be used off of revolving barbell sleeve on smith machine.

Instructions:
- Grasp suspension handles and momentarily step back until arms are extended
  forward and straight. While keeping arms straight and shoulders back
- ' step forward so body reclines back behind suspension handles. Position
  body and legs straight at desired angle hanging from handles with arms straight.
  Internally rotate shoulders so elbows are positioned directly outwards with
  arms straight or slightly bent. Shoulder should be positioned approximately
  90° relative to torso position.'
- Pull handles out to sides while keeping stiff elbow position and maintaining
  shoulder at 90° plane to torso throughout exercise. Raise up until upper
  arms are in-line to one another. Return to original position in same plane
  and repeat.
- 'Upper arms should travel in transverse path at shoulder level without allowing
  elbows to drop to minimize Latissimus Dorsi involvement. A very upright
  position (ie: very light resistance) with one foot positioned slightly back
  (see ''Easier'') is typically required for proper execution. Take care to
  maintain tension on suspension trainer near top of movement. Dismounting
  can be achieved by walking backward until body is upright or stepping out
  at top of movement.'

Instructions:
- Position one dumbbell over head with both hands under inner plate (heart
  shaped grip).
- With elbows over head
- ' lower forearm behind upper arm by flexing elbows. Flex wrists at bottom
  to avoid hitting dumbbell on back of neck. Raise dumbbell over head by extending
  elbows while hyperextending wrists. Return and repeat.'
- Position wrists closer together to keep elbows from pointing out too much.
  Let dumbbell pull back arm to maintain full shoulder flexion. Consider using
  seat with back support as illustrated. Back support should not be so high
  that it interferes with dumbbell being completely lowered (i.e. full range
  of motion). If shoulder flexion flexibility is not adequate
- ' position hips slightly forward (as illustrated) so elbows are positioned
  upward. Position body more upright if shoulder flexion flexibility is adequate.
  See suggested mount & dismount.'

- ' step forward so body is reclined back. Position palms up or slightly inward.'
- Bring handles toward shoulders by flexing arms
- ' while keeping elbows pointed forward. Return by straightening arms and

  at end of movement at any given initial body angle'
- ' thereby creating a peak contraction (greatest resistance at top of movement)
  on elbow flexors which enter into yet another related compromised mechanical
  position (see Tension Potential and Muscle Length-tension Relationship).

  shoulder width overhand grip.
- Pull bar to waist. Return until arms are extended and shoulders are stretched
  forward. Repeat.
- Torso may be kept horizontal for strict execution. Knees are bent in effort
  to keep low back straight (See Hamstring Inflexibility). If low back becomes
  rounded due to tight hamstrings
- ' either try bending knees more or don''t position torso as low. Either
  fix may compromise involvement of Latissimus Dorsi since it forces more
  shoulder transverse extension and less shoulder extension range of motion.
  If low back is rounded due to poor form'
- ' deadlift weight to standing position and lower torso into horizontal position
  with knees bent and back straight. A shoulder width or underhand grip can
  increase lat involvement by emphasizing shoulder extension over transverse
  extension.'

- Pull cable attachment to waist while pulling torso upright. Pull shoulders
  back and push chest forward while arching back. Return until arms are extended
- ' shoulders are stretched forward'
- ' and lower back is flexed forward. Repeat.'
- Begin with light weight and additional weight gradually to allow lower back
  adequate adaptation. Do not pause or bounce at bottom of lift. Do not lower
  weight beyond mild stretch. Full range of motion through lower back will
  vary from person to person. See Cable Seated Row Question. Also see Cable

- Exact stance from bar will depend upon height of fulcrum and length of lever.
  Torso may be kept horizontal for strict execution. Knees are bent in effort
  to keep low back straight (See Hamstring Inflexibility). If low back becomes
  rounded due to tight hamstrings
- ' either try bending knees more or don''t position torso as low. Either
  fix may compromise involvement of Latissimus Dorsi'
- ' since it forces more shoulder transverse extension and less shoulder extension
  range of motion. If low back is rounded due to poor form'
- ' grasp bar in standing position and lower torso into horizontal position
  with knees bent and back straight. A shoulder width or underhand grip can
  increase lat involvement by emphasizing shoulder extension over transverse
  extension. A wide overhand grip involves overall back musculature while
  slightly emphasizing Rear Delt'

- Torso may be kept horizontal for strict execution. Platform (as shown) is
  only needed if smith machine does not allow bar to be lowered to lowest
  position. Knees are bent in effort to keep low back straight (See Hamstring
  Inflexibility). If low back becomes rounded due to tight hamstrings
- ' either knees should be bent more or torso may not be positioned as low.
  Either fix may compromise involvement of Latissimus Dorsi since it forces
  more shoulder transverse extension and less shoulder extension range of
  motion. If low back is rounded due to poor form'
- ' deadlift weight to standing position and lower torso into horizontal position
  with knees bent and back straight. A shoulder width or underhand grip can
  increase lat involvement by emphasizing shoulder extension over transverse
  extension.'

  Place back of heels on elevated surface.
- Keeping body straight
- ' pull body up to bar. Return until arms are extended and shoulders are
  stretched forward. Repeat.'
- Fixed bar should be just high enough to allow arm to fully extend. Placing
  back of heels on elevated surface is optional. This exercise is typically
  performed without added resistance
- ' although additional weight can be placed on belly or pelvis. Partner can
  add and remove weight'
- ' and keep weight from sliding off belly. Resistance can be reduced by raising
  bar and positioning heels on floor. See Gravity Vectors for greater understanding
  of body angle influences resistance. Also known as Body Row or Supine Row.'

  height when held to side of chest. Facing suspension apparatus with feet
  shoulder width apart
- ' point other arm and its shoulder forward'
- ' parallel with angle of strap.'
- Rotate body and extended arm
- ' reaching outward while lowering body downward by extending arm holding

Equipment: Lever (selectorized)
Gif: http://exrx.net/AnimatedEx/PectoralSternal/LVBentOverFly.gif
Force: Push
Muscles: !MuscleBook.MuscleMovementCoder
  Target:
  - 34696
  Synergists:
  - 34687
  - 13109
  - 83003
  - Biceps Brachii Short Head
  Stabilizers:
  - 37670
  - Brachialis
  - 37688
  - Wrist Flexors
  - 9628
  - 13335
Mechanics: Isolation
Type: Auxiliary
Instructions:
- Stand on platform in front of Lever Iron Cross Machine. Grasp handles to
  each side. Bend over at hips with knees and elbows bent slightly. Internally
  rotate shoulders so elbows are pointing upward.
- Bring lever handles together in hugging motion with elbows in fixed position.
  Keep shoulders internally rotated so elbows are pointed upward at top and
  out to sides at bottom. Return to starting position until chest muscles
  are stretched. Repeat.
- Height of platform should allow shoulders to be near the same height of
  fulcrums. Secondary levers compensate somewhat for variations if alignment
  between points of rotation (lever fulcrum and shoulder girdle articulation).
  Under greater resistance
- ' height of platform can be increased so torso can be positioned at lower
  angle downward (by bending over at hips). This will allow upper body weight
  to counterbalance upward pull of levers. See Lever Seated Iron Cross Fly
  and Lever Iron Cross for Lats.'

- Position pad high enough to evenly distribute body weight on thigh but not
  so high that range of motion is limited; abdomen should not press on top
  side of pad when upper body is lowered. Begin with body weight and add additional
  weight gradually to allow lower back adequate adaptation. Do not pause or
  bounce at bottom of lift. Do not lower weight beyond mild stretch throughout
  hamstrings and low back. Full range of motion will vary from person to person.
  Certain individuals may need to keep their neck in neutral position with
  space between their chin and sternum. See Arm Position During Waist Exercises.
  Although articulation of waist is emphasized
- ' some hip extension may accommodate movement. If weight is positioned behind
  head'
- ' neck extensors act as stabilizers'

  feet wide apart; foot of lead leg angled out to side.
- Lower body toward side of angled foot by bending knee and hip of lead leg
  while keeping opposite leg only slightly bent. Return to original standing
  position by extending hip and knee of lead leg. Repeat.
- Keep torso upright and knee of lead leg pointed same direction of foot.
  Flexible hip adductors and stronger legs will allow fuller range of motion.
  A wider stance emphasizes Gluteus Maximus; slightly narrower straddled stance
  emphasizes Quadriceps. Do not position feet too close nor too wide.

Mechanics: Compound
Type: Auxiliary
Instructions:
- Stand with arms extended out in front holding barbell. Balance on one leg
  with opposite leg extended straight leg forward as high as possible.
- Squat down as far as possible while keeping leg elevated off of floor. Keep
  supporting knee pointed same direction as foot supporting. Raise body back
  up to original position until knee and hip of supporting leg is straight.
  Return and repeat. Continue with opposite leg.
- Supporting knee should point same direction as foot throughout movement.
  Range of motion will be improved with greater leg strength and glute flexibility.
  Significant spinal flexion occurs at bottom of deep single leg squat to
  maintain center of gravity over foot. Erector Spinae becomes a stabilizer
  if spine is kept straight. An easier alternative style is to place barbell
  on back of shoulders
- ' cross lower leg above knee of supporting leg or wrap one foot around back
  of supporting leg. An easier alternative style is to place barbell on back
  of shoulders'

Instructions:
- From rack with barbell at upper chest height
- ' position bar on back of shoulders. Grasp barbell to sides. Dismount bar
  from rack and back up until contact is made with box immediately behind.
  Stand with wide stance with feet flared out slightly.'
- Sit back onto box by bending hips back while bending knees
- ' keeping shins nearly perpendicular or knees slightly behind ankles. Lower
  rear end back onto box in controlled manner. Rock torso back slightly. Once
  torso rocks forward'
- ' immediately stand back up rapidly by driving hips upward'
- ' keeping knees above ankles and chest high until legs are straight. Return
  and repeat.'
- Try to keep knees from traveling forward while reaching rear end back onto
  squat box. Ideally
- ' knees could be behind ankles. In this position'
- ' greater stretch reflex can be created through hips (via hamstrings) once
  torso rocks forward just before squat. However'

  slightly below lowest position of barbell in case of fail. Box''s height
  could allow pivot point of hips to travel slightly lower than pivot point
  of knee'
- ' however'
- ' programmed partials can be performed on higher box. Rubber mats can be
  stacked on top of box to adjust to intended height. Box can be orientated
  diagonally so corners can be straddled'
- ' so box is more directly under hips in standing position. Do not fall on
  to or bounce off of box. Keep head facing forward'
- ' back straight and feet flat on floor. Keep knees apart so thighs point
  same direction as feet throughout movement. Involvement of Quadriceps and

  to support pelvis. Raise bent leg up so lower leg is approximately horizonal
  above hip. If lying on floor
- ' raise other leg slightly off of floor.'
- Simultaneously change positions of legs
- ' lowering and straightening raised leg down just above floor while raising
  and bending lower leg to opposite position. Continue alternating leg positions.'
- Rectus Abdominis and Obliques only contract dynamically if actual waist
  flexion occurs. With no waist flexion
- ' Rectus Abdominis and External Oblique will only act to stabilize pelvis
  and waist during hip flexion. Conversely'
- ' it may be necessary to completely flex hips before waist flexion is possible'
- ' which is not practical with alternating leg movements. Also see Spot Reduction

Name: Cable Lying Hip External Rotation
Input: 11
Equipment: Cable
Gif: http://exrx.net/AnimatedEx/HipExternalRotators/CBLyingExternalHipRotation.gif
Force: Pull
Muscles: !MuscleBook.MuscleMovementCoder
  Target:
  - Hip External Rotators
  Synergists:
  - Gemellus superior
  - Gemellus inferior
  - Obturator internus
  - Obturator externus
  - Quadratus femoris
  Stabilizers:
  - 13335
  - Adductors Hip
Mechanics: Isolation
Type: Auxiliary
Instructions:
- Attach cable ankle cuff to ankle
- ' nearest low pulley. Lie prone with legs slightly apart and knee of attached
  leg bent 90°. Adjust position of legs slightly away from cable pulley so
  slight stretch is felt in hip.'
- Keeping knee of attached leg bent approximately 90°
- ' pull cable attachment toward opposite knee by rotating hip. Return until
  slight stretch is felt in hip'
- ' then repeat. Place ankle cuff on opposite leg and continue lying opposite
  direction.'
- Exercise name is somewhat counter-intuitive since direction of rotation
  is relative to movement of hip
- ' or thigh'
- ' not bent leg. For example'
- ' in this exercises'
- ' external rotation of hip causes front of thigh to turn outward despite
  bent leg moving inward. Incidentally if knee were straight during external
  rotation of thigh'
- ' foot would move outward.'

Mechanics: Isolation
Type: Auxiliary
Instructions:
- Sit on bench or chair with low pulley to side. Attach cable ankle cuff to
  ankle
- ' nearest pulley. Place far stationary foot slightly forward. Grasp lower
  thigh of leg with attached cuff'
- ' position it along side thigh of stationary leg while keeping foot slightly
  above floor.'
- Keeping knee of attached leg bent approximately 90°
- ' pull cable attachment under thigh of stationary leg by rotating hip. Return
  until slight stretch is felt in hip'
- ' then repeat. Place ankle cuff on opposite leg and continue facing opposite
  direction.'
- Height of knee on exercising leg may require subtle adjustment during movement
  to permit clearance of traveling foot above floor. Gluteus Maximus will
  be activated as stabilizer on heavier loads when participant pushes stationary
  foot onto floor thereby anchoring lower body as hip adductors keep thighs
  together. Upper body muscles can also assist in keeping thigh of exercising
  leg along side stationary leg. Exercise name is somewhat counter-intuitive
  since direction of rotation is relative to movement of hip
- ' or thigh'

Instructions:
- Sit on seat and position forefeet on pedals. Grasp handles to sides and

- Push left pedal by extending ankle knee Simultaneously allow right pedal
  to return back by relaxing ankle and bending knee more. Reverse motion by
  pushing right pedal and allowing left pedal to return back by same means.
  Continue to alternate motion.
- Position seat to allow full range of motion. Gastrocnemius act as dynamic
  stabilizers because when they 'contract' at ankle they are simultaneously
  'stretched' at knee. It could be argued they also act as synergist since
  bend at knee could be considered relatively smaller range of motion as compared
  to ankle articulation resulting in net contraction of Gastrocnemius. See
  Calf Exercise Analyses. Also see Lever Alternating Seated Calf Extension
